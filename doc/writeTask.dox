\section pipeTasks_writeTask_overview Overview

This document describes how to write a data processing task. For an introduction to data processing tasks,
please read \ref pipeBase_introduction "pipe_base introduction".
It also helps to have a basic understanding of data repositories and how to use the butler to read
and write data (to be written; for now read existing tasks to see how it is done).

After reading this document you may wish to read \ref pipeTasks_writeCmdLineTask
for additional information needed to write a \ref pipeBase_introduction "command-line task".

Tasks are subclasses of \ref lsst.pipe.base.task.Task "lsst.pipe.base.Task" or (command-line tasks)
\ref lsst.pipe.base.cmdLineTask.CmdLineTask "lsst.pipe.base.CmdLineTask".

Tasks are constructed by calling `__init__` with the task
\ref pipeTasks_writeTask_configuration "configuration".
Occasionally additional arguments are required (see the task's documentation for details).
\ref lsst.pipe.base.task.Task.__init__ "lsst.pipe.base.Task.__init__" has a few other arguments that are
usually only specified when a task is created as a subtask of another task; you will probably 
never have to specify them yourself. (Command-line tasks are often constructed and run by calling parseAndRun,
as described in \ref pipeTasks_writeCmdLineTask.)

Tasks typically have a `run` method that executes the task's main function.
See \ref pipeTasks_writeTask_taskMethods for more information.

\section pipeTasks_writeTask_configuration Configuration

Every task requires a configuration: a task-specific set of configuration parameters.
The configuration is read-only; once you construct a task, the same configuration will be used
to process all data with that task. This makes the data processing more predictable:
it does not depend on the order in which items of data are processed.

The task's configuration is specified using the \ref secConfigIntro "pex_config package",
as a task-specific subclass of \ref lsst.pex.config.config.Config "lsst.pex.config.Config".
The task class specifies its configuration class using class variable `ConfigClass`. If the task
has no configuration parameters then it may use \ref lsst.pex.config.config.Config "lsst.pex.config.Config"
as its configuration class.

Some important details of configurations:
- __Supply useful defaults for all config parameters__ if at all possible.
    Your task will be much easier to use if the default configuration usually suffices.
- Please document each field of the configuration carefully. Pretend you don't know anything
    about your task and ask yourself what you would need to be told to change the parameter.
    What does the parameter do and why might you change it? What units does it have?
- Subtasks are specified in your configuration as fields of type
    \ref lsst.pex.config.configurableField.ConfigurableField "lsst.pex.config.ConfigurableField".
    This allows subtasks to be \ref pipeTasks_writeCmdLineTask_retargetingSubtasks "retargeted"
    (replaced with a variant subtask).

exampleTask.ExampleSigmaClippedStatsTask uses configuration class exampleTask.ExampleSigmaClippedStatsConfig:
\dontinclude tasks/exampleTask.py
\skip class ExampleSigmaClippedStatsConfig
\until end ExampleSigmaClippedStatsConfig

The configuration class is specified as ExampleSigmaClippedStatsTask class variable `ConfigClass`,
as described in \ref pipeTasks_writeTask_classVariables.

\section pipeTasks_writeTask_documentation Documentation

For others to use your task, it must be clearly documented. \link pipe/tasks/exampleTask.py\endlink
provides a useful example and documentation template.

Content should include:
- The task's purpose.
- An overview of the important task methods, including `run` (if present), including links to the detailed documentation for each method.
- The detailed documentation for each method must carefully describe its parameters, including data type (unless blindingly obvious). If a method takes a data reference or a butler, describe which dataset types are read and written.
- A link to the config class, which should have clear help strings for each parameter.
- A description of debug options.
- A complete working example.

Use """! instead of """ to start doc strings (i.e. include an exclamation mark). This causes
Doxygen to parse Doxygen commands in the doc string, which is almost always what you want.

Include a section such as the following in your task's documentation. This will make it appear on the
page \ref LSST_task_documentation, even if your task is not in the pipe_tasks package.
\code
## \addtogroup LSST_task_documentation
## \{
## \page exampleTask
## \ref ExampleCmdLineTask "ExampleCmdLineTask"
##      An example intended to show how to write a command-line task.
## \}
\endcode

\section pipeTasks_writeTask_classVariables Class Variables

Tasks require several class variables to function:
- `ConfigClass`: the \ref pipeTasks_writeTask_configuration "configuration class" used by the task.

- `_DefaultName`: a string used as the default name for the task. This is required for a
    \ref pipe.base.CmdLineTask "command-line task", and strongly recommended for other tasks
    because it makes them easier to construct for unit tests.
    Note that when a task creates a subtask, it ignores the subtask's `_DefaultName` and assigns
    the name of the config parameter as the subtask's name. For example
    exampleTask.ExampleCmdLineConfig creates the statistics subtask with name "stats"
    because the config field for that subtask is `stats = lsst.pex.config.ConfigurableField(...)`.

    Task names are used for the hierarchy of task and subtask metadata. Also, for command-line tasks
    the name is used as a component of the of the dataset type for saving the task's
    configuration and metadata; see  \ref pipeTasks_writeCmdLineTask_persistingConfigAndMetadata
    for more information.

- `TaskRunner`: only needed for command-line tasks; see pipeTasks_writeCmdLineTask for more information.

Here are the class variables for exampleTask.ExampleCmdLineTask:
\dontinclude tasks/exampleTask.py
\skip class ExampleCmdLineTask
\skip ConfigClass
\until # end

\section pipeTasks_writeTask_taskMethods Methods

Tasks have the following important methods:
- `__init__`: construct and initialize a task
- `run`: process one item of data

These methods are described in more depth below:

\subsection pipeTasks_writeTask_initMethod The __init__ Method

Use the `__init__` method (task constructor) to do the following:
- Call the parent task's `__init__` method
- Make subtasks by calling `self.makeSubtask(<name>)`, where `<name>` is the name
    of a field of type \ref lsst.pex.config.configurableField.ConfigurableField "lsst.pex.config.ConfigurableField" in your task's
    pipeTasks_writeTask_configuration "configuration".
- Make a schema if your task uses an \ref afwTable "afw table". For an example of such a task
    see lsst.pipe.tasks.calibrate.CalibrateTask.
- Initialize any other instance variables your task needs.

Here is exampleTask.ExampleCmdLineTask.__init__:
\dontinclude tasks/exampleTask.py
\skip class ExampleCmdLineTask
\skip def \_\_init\_\_
\until # end

That task creates a subtask named `stats` to compute image statistics.
Here is the \_\_init\_\_ method for the default version of the `stats` subtask:
exampleTask.ExampleSigmaClippedStatsTask, which is slightly more interesting:
\dontinclude tasks/exampleTask.py
\skip class ExampleSigmaClippedStatsTask
\skip def \_\_init\_\_
\until # end
This creates a binary mask identifying bad pixels in the mask plane
and an lsst.afw.math.StatisticsControl, specifying how statistics are computed.
Both of these are constants, and thus are the same for each invocation of the `run` method;
this is strongly recommended, as explained in the next section.

\subsection pipeTasks_writeTask_runMethod The run Method

Most tasks have a `run` method which perform's the task's data processing operation.
This is required for command-line tasks and strongly recommended for most other tasks.
One exception is if your task needs different methods to handle different data types
(C++ handles this using overloaded functions, but the standard technique is Python
is to provide different methods for different call signatures).

If your task's processing can be divided into logical units, then we recommend that
you provide methods for each unit. `run` can then call each method to do its work.
This allows your task to be more easily adapted: a subclass can override just a few methods.

We strongly recommend that you make your task stateless, by not using instance variables
as part of your data processing. Pass data between methods by calling and returning it.
This makes the task much easier to reason about, since processing one item of data
cannot affect future items of data.

The `run` method should always return its results in an lsst.pipe.base.struct.Struct object,
with a named field for each item of data. This is safer than returning a tuple of items,
and allows adding fields without affecting existing code. Other methods should also
return Structs if they return more than one or two items.

Any method that is likely to take significant time or memory should be preceded by this python decorator:
<code>\@lsst.pipe.base.timeMethod</code>. This automatically records the execution time and memory
of the method in the task's `metadata` attribute.

The example exampleTask.ExampleCmdLineTask is so simple that it needs no other methods;
`run` does everything:
\dontinclude tasks/exampleTask.py
\skip class ExampleCmdLineTask
\skip # start run
\until # end run

The statistics are actually computed by the `stats` subtask. Here is the run method for the default
version of that task: exampleTask.ExampleSigmaClippedStatsTask.run:
\dontinclude tasks/exampleTask.py
\skip class ExampleSigmaClippedStatsTask
\skip # start run
\until # end run

\section pipeTasks_writeTask_taskMethods Methods

If you want your task to support debug variables, have it import the lsstDebug package
and call `lsstDebug.Info(__name__).`&lt;name&gt; to look for a debug variable named &lt;name&gt;.
If you look for a variable that the user has not specified, it will have a value of `None`.
For example, to look for a debug variable named `display`:

\code{.py}
  import lsstDebug
  display = lsstDebug.Info(__name__).display
  if display:
     ...
\endcode

See pipeBase_argumentParser_debugVariables for information on specifying specify debug variables
while running a command-line task.
