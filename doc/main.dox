\section pipeBase_introduction Introduction

Each data processing pipeline is implemented as a task that is a subclass of pipeBase.Task.
Tasks often call subtasks, which are also instances of pipeBase.Task. See pipe_base documentation
for more information about the basics of writing and using tasks. See the individual tasks in pipe_tasks
for information about the available pipeline tasks and subtasks.
