\section pipeTasks_introduction Introduction

Each data processing pipeline is implemented as a task that is a subclass of pipe_base CmdLineTask.
Tasks often call other tasks as subtasks; these may be derived from CmdLineTask or Task.
See pipe_base documentation for more information about the basics of writing and using tasks.
See the individual tasks in pipe_tasks for information about the available pipeline tasks and subtasks.
